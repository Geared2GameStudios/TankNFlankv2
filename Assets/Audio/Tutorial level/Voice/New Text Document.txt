Welcome to tank n flank. My name is BOOM, which stands for ballistics ordinance operations mech. I will help you from time to time while you are at the helm of this tank...

Lets first start off by learning how the tank moves. You can use the left stick on the gamepad to drive the tank and the right stick to control the turret. Go ahead and move up to the big rock blocking your way down this path marked with big green objective marker.

Great, to help you stay oriented you can press the A button on your gamepad to toggle the HUD. This will show the current rotation of the base of the tank and  turret. Try it now.

To remove the rock from your path you can use the right trigger to fire. If you want to view the targeting reticle press the right button. Try them both out on the rock ahead.

Amazing, go ahead and clear the next few obstacles and practice targeting. Your in enemy territory and bound to run into an enemy soon.

Your doing awesome so far. The house up ahead is a prime target to find supplies and drops. Once you destroy the house if you see a blue pickup marker, use your y button to call your support to go and retrieve it for you. 

Great, you have collected the smoke power up you can deploy this by pressing the X button on your gamepad. Quickly deploy the smoke to throw off the enemy that is approaching. You can back up to the tree line behind you and wait for the kill. 

Wow. You have destroyed the enemy tank. proceed up to the bridge for further instructions.

Congratulations. you have completed the tank n flank tutorial demo. This was just a taste of the final project. Be sure to join us in 8 more weeks for the gold release of this project.
